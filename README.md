# Calculator Project
This is my third project involving the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have had many gaps of knowledge in the process of completing this project. Many of these gaps have been filled thanks to the internet, and many are still very much present. An example of gained knowledge would involve the event listeners. I previously had a forEach that added an event listener for each individual button. I now have a single document body event listener that passes the event target as a parameter, and thus the functionality remains unchanged while only requiring one event listener. For information that is still out of my reach, I am clueless as to why my website works so much differently on mobile devices. I have tried setting the padding to zero and aligning the text to center, however the "clear" button text is still unaligned on mobile devices. I have decided to at this time conclude working on this project. I have worked on nothing but this calculator for the past week, and I am worried that burnout will strike. I will return when my knowledge in JS and CSS has improved. In terms of lessons learned, I wish I had tried it on mobile devices at a much earlier time. If I had learned that issues were present when my code was minimal, solving those issues would have been much more simple.

# to-do
Fix text align on mobile\
Fix negative button text on mobile\
Remove button delay on mobile\
Make any single number equal that number when user presses enter without entering any operator\
Allow negative zero when pressing negative button when zero is the display number\
(maybe) Show log of inputted numbers, operators, and outcomes
